REFLECTION DOCUMENT

Briefly describe your project. 

Student StarCraft AI Tournament (SSCAIT) provides a way for people interested in bot development to talk and share ideas. This project is to submit a finished bot for that competition. 

How did you meet, exceed, or fall short of your original expectations? 

I fell very, very short of my expectations. I expected to get at least ten times farther than I actually did. The problem is that this project is far larger than I ever thought possible. 

What changes were made to your project during the process? 

No changes to the project premise or conceit, but I did change the timeline quite a few times. 

What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about the new computer science topics you learned about? 

I didn’t actually get to anything new here, so I can’t answer this question. 

What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about the project itself? 

I think that the most interesting thing I learned from this project was about the Brood War API and how effective they have made its integration with StarCraft. 

What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about yourself? 

I think that the most important thing I learned about this myself is that I am very prone to overestimating my abilities. I don’t know half as much as I think I do, and I have a lot of learning left to do. 

Final Thoughts 

If I were to do this over again knowing what I know now, I would set my expectations far, far lower.
